INTERN ID: CT04DG1545

DOMAIN: C PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION: TO BUILD A SIMPLE LEXICAL ANALYZER IN C THAT:
READS A SOURCE CODE FILE (MYFILE.TXT)

IDENTIFIES AND PRINTS:
KEYWORDS (E.G., INT, IF, RETURN)
IDENTIFIERS (E.G., VARIABLE NAMES LIKE A, MAIN)
OPERATORS (E.G., +, -, =, ETC.)

TOOL TYPE NAME:
EDITOR : VS CODE

COMPILER : c compiler

LANGUAGE : C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

OS : WINDOWS

FILE : MYFILE.TXT

THE COMPILER DESIGN BASICS PROGRAM WRITTEN IN C SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMS THE BASIC TASK OF TOKENIZING INPUT FROM A SOURCE CODE FILE. IT ACCURATELY CLASSIFIES KEYWORDS, IDENTIFIERS, AND OPERATORS BY SCANNING THE FILE CHARACTER BY CHARACTER. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF:
HOW LEXICAL ANALYSIS IS DONE IN COMPILERS,
HOW TO USE FILE HANDLING, STRING MANIPULATION, AND CHARACTER TESTING IN C.
